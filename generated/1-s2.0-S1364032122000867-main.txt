The international passenger car market is undergoing a transition from vehicles with internal combustion
engines to hybrid and fully electrified vehicles to reduce the climate impact of the transportation sector. To
emphasize the importance of this needed change, this paper provides holistic comparisons of the total life-cycle
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced by a wide selection of commercially available passenger cars with
different powertrains and energy sources. Simple analytical models are used to quantify the total life-cycle GHG
emissions in terms of CO2-equivalent values relative to the vehicle curb weight and the peak motor power.
The production, utilization and recycling emissions are separately quantified based on the latest reviewed
emission coefficient values. In total 790 different vehicle variants are considered. The results show that Battery
Electric Vehicles have the highest production emissions. For example, the additional production emissions of a
Tesla Model 3 Standard Plus approximately correspond to the driving emissions of a Volkwagen Passat 2.0 TSI
after 18 000 km. Nonetheless, it is shown that conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles emit the highest amount
of total life-cycle GHGs in comparison to vehicles powered by other available energy resources. When using
green electricity, plug-in hybrid electric and fully electric vehicles can reduce the total life-cycle emission
in comparison to combustion engine vehicles by 73% and 89%, respectively. A similar emission reduction is
achieved by biogas powered vehicles (81%). Fuel cell vehicles approximately reduce the GHG emission to a
similar extent as electric vehicles (charged with conventional electricity) when using commercially available
gray hydrogen (60%).. Introduction
In 2019, the European Commission published the European Green
eal, as described and discussed in [1,2]. It comprises a strategy with
he primary goal to increase the sustainability of the European Union’s
EU) economy and to make Europe climate neutral in 2050. One of its
ajor milestones is the significant reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
missions, such as CO2, by a minimum of 50% until 2030 in comparison
o 1990 emission levels. Therefore, it is also planned to reach climate
eutrality within the transportation sector, which can be essentially
chieved by reducing passenger vehicles’ GHG emissions [3].
Currently, different energy sources, such as liquid fuels, fuel gases or
ithium-ion batteries, can be used to power passenger cars [4,5]. Typi-
ally, Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEV) constantly emit CO2
hile driving, whereas Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Fuel Cell
lectric Vehicles (FCEV) do not. Accordingly, consumer information
rochures only describe passenger vehicles’ driving emissions, which

might mislead consumers to believe that Zero-Emission Vehicles (ZEV)
do not emit any CO2, since any other life-cycle emission aspects are
omitted [6]. However, the primary energy sources of the electricity
used to charge BEVs’ batteries or to produce hydrogen, as well as
the emissions created from vehicles’ production, and to a lesser extent
the disposal/recycling, must be considered when comparing passenger
vehicles’ total CO2 emissions. Therefore, Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA)
in terms of equivalent CO2 emissions is a common approach to fairly
compare the climate impact of different vehicles [7]. Although, due
to the steady improvement of battery production/recycling techniques
and local developments of green energy generation plants, LCA results
involving BEVs can quickly become outdated. Furthermore, certain
GHG aspects like the electricity carbon intensity [8] or the carbon
emissions associated with the fuel transportation, such as crude oil ship-
ping [9] or hydrogen transportation [10], do locally vary. Thus, asvailable online 10 February 2022

pointed out in [11] or [12], it is difficult to directly compare LCA
results from different research papers.
For example, an LCA comparison between an ICEV and a BEV
in China from 2018 is given in [13], which concludes that BEVs do
not achieve any GHG emission reductions in comparison to similar
ICEVs due to the carbon-intensive power generation in China, affecting
the battery production and driving emissions. Similar conclusions are
drawn in [14,15] for a BEV and ICEV comparison in Australia and
for heavy-duty transports in Europe, respectively. In contrast, in [16]
it is stated that the required emissions for the production of a Tesla
size battery can correspond to the driving emissions of an ICEV after
8.2 years. In comparison to these publications, the research in [17]
reveals that modern production techniques, as used for example in
the United States of America (USA), can reduce the GHG emissions of
Chinese battery manufacturing plants by about two thirds. Therefore,
other LCA comparisons indicate that mid-size BEVs can reduce the life-
cycle CO2 emissions by 16% to 46% [18,19] in comparison to ICEVs,
especially if renewable energy is available as a primary energy source
for charging [20] and when including also the battery recycling process
into the LCA [21]. Latest investigations show similar emission reduction
tendencies for Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) [22], electric
and hybrid buses [23], as well as electric trucks [24] in comparison
to their combustion engine counterparts. In addition, as described
in [25], the effect of the vehicle size and the battery capacity on the
GHG emissions is less pronounced for EVs than for ICEVs. Moreover,
as stated in [26], modern battery recycling techniques are under de-
velopment and, thus, the climate impact of the recycling process is
steadily improving as well. Nowadays, almost all battery materials can
be recycled, as stated by [27], and the required energy amount is
steadily decreasing [28].
However, the LCA investigations of the above mentioned research
articles highlight only the role of a limited vehicle selection or partly2

pure hypothetical vehicles. Additionally, none of the research articles
include vehicles’ total lifetime emissions from the production to the
recycling emissions considering the latest emissions coefficients, such
as given in [28]. Hence, no holistic GHG emission comparisons of a
large variety of commercially available vehicles with different kinds of
energy sources can be found yet.
Therefore, the contribution of this paper is to give a comprehen-
sive/holistic overview about the total CO2 equivalent life-cycle emis-
sions from a broad selection of commercially available passenger cars
with different powertrains and energy sources. For this purpose, the
latest emission parameters are extensively reviewed, a vehicle data
base with 790 different car variants is created and, further, the produc-
tion, utilization, including the Well-to-Wheel (WtW), and the recycling
emissions are considered. Moreover, the life-cycle emissions are charac-
terized relative to the vehicle curb weight and the peak motor power.
Within the scope of this paper, the aspect of any kind of second-life
battery utilization has not been taken into account.
2. Modeling of estimated life-cycle CO𝟐-equivalent emissions
This chapter gives a brief but comprehensive description about the
analytical models used within the scope of this paper to estimate and,
consequently, to compare vehicles’ total GHG emissions in terms of
CO2-equivalent (CO2-eq.) emissions. LCA is an unbiased approach to
ompare the environmental impacts associated with all the stages of
product’s life cycle [29]. It considers for instance a product’s GHG
missions associated with the product’s production and manufacturing
rocess, utilization, maintenance, End-of-Life (EoL) treatment and final
isposal [14,19]. Often, vehicles’ total life-cycle emissions can be gener-
lly categorized into three distinct parts/phases: production, utilization
nd recycling emissions. Typically, GHG emissions are quantified in
erms of CO2-eq. emissions, which is a metric measure used to com-
are various greenhouse gases [22] in terms of their global warming

life-cycle emissions 𝐸life,tot can be calculated as
𝐸life,tot = 𝐸prod,tot + 𝐸util,tot + 𝐸recyc,tot (1)
with 𝐸prod,tot , 𝐸util,tot and 𝐸recyc,tot being the total production, utilization
and recycling emissions, respectively. In the following, the individual
life-cycle emission parts are described in detail. Furthermore, simple
analytical models are introduced to quickly quantify vehicles’ life-cycle
emissions relative to vehicles’ curb weight, battery capacity, drive cycle
emissions and life time in terms of the total traveled distance. The
methodology used to calculate the total life-cycle GHG emissions is
schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. At first, the production emissions
of every vehicle are calculated according to Section 2.1. Then, the
utilization emissions are estimated, as described in Section 2.2, before
completing the GHG emission calculation with the recycling emissions,
as explained in Section 2.3. Since the database includes several hun-
dreds of different vehicle models, the equations are kept simple while
accounting for a reasonable amount of uncertainties. The numerical
values used for all calculations originate from literature as outlined in
Section 3. The bibliographic references were surveyed based on their
date of publication, favoring newer information, and on their depth of
detail.
2.1. Production emissions
Even before a vehicle can be used to transport goods or passengers,
a large amount of GHGs must be emitted to exploit a vehicle’s raw
materials and to manufacture the vehicle itself [17], referred to in here
as production emissions. As similarly described in [14], a vehicle’s total
CO2-eq. production emissions 𝐸prod,tot can be estimated according to
𝐸prod,tot = 𝑚veh,body ⋅ 𝑒prod,body + 𝐶bat ⋅ 𝑒prod,bat (2)
with 𝑚veh,body and 𝐶bat being the vehicle curb weight in kg and the
traction battery capacity (only for types of EVs) in kWh. Further-
more, 𝑒prod,body and 𝑒prod,bat are the relative CO2-eq. emission for the
vehicle body and the traction battery, given in kg CO2 − eq.∕kg and
kg CO2 − eq.∕ kWh, respectively. The vehicle curb weight 𝑚veh can be
distinguished into the body mass 𝑚veh,body and the battery mass 𝑚veh,bat
according to
𝑚veh = 𝑚veh,body + 𝑚veh,bat = 𝑚veh,body +
𝐶bat
𝜉bat
(3)
with 𝐶𝑏𝑎𝑡 and 𝜉𝑏𝑎𝑡 being the battery’s nominal capacity in kWh and
specific energy in kWh/kg, respectively.
2.2. Utilization emissions
After a vehicle is produced and delivered to the consumer, GHGs
are constantly emitted when utilizing the vehicle and for its mainte-
nance/repair, referred to in [7] as operational emissions. However, the
emissions necessary for the production of expendable/spare parts, such
as new tires, coolant fluids or lubricant oils, and vehicles’ maintenance
are very low in comparison to the emissions produced by the utilization
of the vehicle [14,17]. Moreover, based on the user’s driving profile and
behavior, vehicles’ actual service intervals strongly differ. Hence, the3
emissions associated with the production of spare parts and vehicles’
maintenance are neglected within the scope of this paper. Therefore,
the total CO2-eq. utilization emissions 𝐸util,tot can be calculated as
𝐸util,tot = 𝑐WLTP ⋅ 𝑒WtW ⋅ 𝑆lifetime (4)
with 𝑐WLTP and 𝑆lifetime being the relative energy/fuel consumption,
based on the Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicles Test Proce-
dure (WLTP), for example given in L/100 km, and the expected vehicle
life time in km, respectively. The relative CO2-eq. WtW emissions 𝑒WtW
are for example given in kg CO2 − eq.∕L. As schematically depicted
in [7], the relative WtW emissions can be separated according to
𝑒wtw = 𝑒wtt + 𝑒ttw (5)
with 𝑒wtt and 𝑒ttw being the Well-to-Tank (WtT) and the Tank-to-Wheel
(TtW) emissions. Considering the scheme in [7], the WtT emissions
typically consider the processes of the energy source extraction, the
energy carrier production and the energy carrier distribution, whereas
the TtW emissions consider only the energy conversion process to
actually propel the vehicle.
The second-life usage of vehicle batteries, such as described in [30],
can reduce a vehicle’s utilization emissions, but this effect is not
considered within the scope of this paper.
2.2.1. Tank-to-wheel emissions during the worldwide harmonized light-duty
vehicles test procedure
To estimate vehicles’ relative fuel/energy consumption and the
relative CO2-eq. TtW emissions, standardized driving cycles are typi-
cally used. In 2017, the WLTP succeeded the New European Driving
Cycle (NEDC) as the globally standardized test procedure to determine
passenger vehicle’s driving consumption and driving emissions. This
driving cycle should produce more realistic results than the replaced
NEDC by being approximately 50% longer in time and it comprises
higher absolute driving speeds [31,32]. In general, the WLTP consists
of four parts, referred to as Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicle
Test Cycles (WLTC), with low, medium, high and extra-high driving
speeds. Overall, the WLTP’s time duration is 1800 s and its total driving
range is about 23 km, as shown in [33]. The WLTP’s speed profile is
depicted in Fig. 2.
Typically, driving cycle tests are conducted in a laboratory envi-
ronment and the test vehicle is only operated on a dynamometer test
bench.
The emissions of conventional ICEVs can be directly measured from
the exhaust gas emitted from the tail pipes. Thus, the relative CO2
equivalent TtW emissions of ICEVs can be directly calculated according
to
𝑒ttw =
𝐸CO2 ,tot
𝐷WLTP
(6)
with 𝐸CO2 ,tot and 𝐷WLTP being the measured total CO2-eq. emissions
and the WLTPs driving distance, respectively.
In contrast, the measurement of PHEVs’ emissions is more difficult,
since PHEVs can be propelled by both the electric motor (which does
not locally emit any CO2) or the internal combustion engine. Therefore,
a strategy for calculating PHEVs’ overall emissions was elaborated
and appointed in the Amendment 4 of the United Nations Global
Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 159 (2022) 112158J. Buberger et al.

Technical Regulation on Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicles
Test Procedures (ECE/TRANS/180/Add.15) [34]. In a nutshell, PHEVs’
battery energy and fuel consumption during the WLTP must be fairly
distinguished. Therefore, a Utility Factor (UF) shall be used, which is
defined as the ratio between the distance driven in battery ‘charge
depleting’ mode divided by the WLTP’s total distance [35,36]. With the
measured emissions in each cycle and the calculated UF, the amount of
the total CO2 emissions corresponds to
CO2 ,tot = 𝑈𝐹 ⋅ 𝐸CO2 ,CD + (1 − 𝑈𝐹 ) ⋅ 𝐸CO2 ,CS (7)
ith 𝐸CO2 ,CD and 𝐸CO2 ,CS being the CO2 emissions associated with
he ’charge depleting’ and ’charge sustaining’ mode, respectively. The
elative CO2-eq. TtW emissions of PHEVs can similarly be calculated
s given in (6). Nonetheless, when assessing PHEVs’ WtT emissions,
he relative electrical and the fuel consumption must be separately
onsidered.
In comparison, BEVs’ and FCEVs’ CO2 emissions during driving are
efined to be zero, since they do not locally emit any CO2. Their
fuel or electricity consumption, however, must be measured. Typically,
vehicles’ TtW emissions are issued by manufacturers’ sales divisions,
since they are important for vehicles’ taxation according to current
regulations.
2.2.2. Uncertainty of well-to-tank emissions
As mentioned before, the TtW emissions only cover a part of the
total utilization emissions. Therefore, to fully assess the utilization
emissions, the WtT emissions must be considered as well. These should
include all emissions from the production, the storage and, further, the
shipping/transportation of the used fuel or transmission of the electric
energy. However, the WtT emissions cannot be estimated or quantified
using standardized test procedures, since these can differ based on dif-
ferent aspects. As investigated and stated in [37,38], the WtT emissions
significantly vary depending on the considered location. For example
in [9], the authors analyze the shipping emissions per liter of crude
oil when shipped along various trade lanes. When shipped from the
Arabian Gulf to North America, the maritime transport would account
for up to 11% of the WtT emissions. In contrast, when shipped from
the Arabian Gulf to Southeast Asia, the maritime transport corresponds
only to 3%. Therefore, it must be taken into account that the LCA
omparisons, such as given in [17,19,23,24], are to a certain extent4
nly locally valid. l2.3. Recycling emissions
The last GHG emission in a vehicle’s life are associated with the
recycling after decommissioning. Normally, the final recycling pro-
cess [39,40] actually reduces vehicles’ CO2-eq. emission footprint, since
the recycled material from scrapped cars can be reused to a great
extent. As described in [41], the production of traction batteries is
often controversially discussed to be very carbon intensive, but the
proper recycling can significantly reduce BEVs’ total life-cycle CO2-eq.
emissions.
The total CO2-eq. recycling emissions 𝐸recyc,tot are calculated as
𝐸recyc,tot = 𝑚veh,body ⋅ 𝑒recyc,body + 𝐶bat ⋅ 𝑒recyc,bat (8)
ith 𝑒recyc,body and 𝑒recyc,bat being the relative recycling coefficients for
ehicles’ bodies, given in kg CO2 − eq.∕kg, and batteries, given in
g CO2 − eq.∕kWh, respectively.
. Vehicle database and review of life-cycle assessment parame-
ers
For the life-cycle emission comparisons, a database of vehicles was
reated, which should fairly represent the majority of all commer-
ially available passenger cars, such as Volkswagen Passat, Audi A4,
esla Model 3, Toyota Mirai, Mercedes-Benz C 300 d, etc. The main
oal was to include as many different vehicle models as possible,
onsidering various manufacturers, which is quite cumbersome when
onsidering all commercially-available vehicle variants. For this reason
nly one chassis variant with the most basic equipment was con-
idered for each vehicle model and only two drivetrain variants per
ehicle were selected, representing the vehicle’s lowest and highest
ossible peak motor power. Moreover, different publicly accessible
nergy sources were considered, such as gasoline, diesel, liquid petrol
as (LPG), compressed natural gas (CNG), compressed biogas (CBG),
ydrogen (H2) and electricity. When energy sources other than gasoline
nd diesel were possible to order for a specific vehicle, corresponding
rive train variants for each energy source were additionally added. In
otal, 790 different vehicle variants were considered.
The values of vehicles’ curb weight 𝑚veh, relative WLTP energy
onsumption 𝑐WLTP and battery gross capacity 𝐶bat were obtained from
fficial product specification sheets, major car journals or review infor-
ation websites, such as given in [42].
As described in [43], vehicles’ production emissions can differ
ocally. For example, according to [43], the production emissions of

a compact car (𝑚veh = 1292.8 kg) correspond to 9596.9 kg CO2 − eq. in
hina, whereas in the US these are only 6241.2 kg CO2 − eq. Within
he scope of this paper, only one value should be chosen for each of
he relative production emission coefficients 𝑒prod,body and 𝑒prod,bat . This
pproach should simplify the LCA, but still allows to fairly compare dif-
erent vehicle variants. The study in [44] compared different variants of
olkswagen’s vehicle model Golf, such as its gasoline, diesel, CNG and
EV variant. The relative production emissions 𝑒prod,body (excluding the
EV’s lithium-ion battery) based on the values given in [44] correspond
o 4.56 kg CO2 − eq.∕kg for the gasoline model, 4.73 kg CO2 − eq.∕kg
or the diesel model and 4.16 kg CO2 − eq.∕kg for the CNG model. As
imilarly described in [43,45], the relative production emissions for a
asoline compact car (𝑚veh ≈ 1300 kg) produced in the USA range from
.17 kg CO2 − eq.∕kg to 4.82 kg CO2 − eq.∕kg. Nevertheless, as described
n [44], it is unclear which fraction of the BEV’s production emissions
riginate from the battery pack. Based on [14,17,43,45], a similar pro-
uction emission coefficient 𝑒prod,body can be concluded for BEVs’ body.
ith the help of BEVs’ nominal battery capacity 𝐶bat and batteries’
pecific energy 𝜉bat , the weight of a vehicles traction battery can be
stimated according to (3). As listed in [46], batteries’ specific energy
bat can be assumed to be about 200Wh/kg. Furthermore, according
o [27,47], the most recent studies estimate batteries’ production emis-
ions coefficient 𝑒prod,bat , ranging from 61.6 kg CO2 − eq.∕kWh up to
06.0 kg CO2 − eq.∕kWh. within the scope of this paper, a production
mission coefficient 𝑒prod,body of 4.56 kg CO2 − eq.∕kg was selected for
ehicles’ bodies (corresponding to that of the gasoline model in [44]).
urthermore, an emissions coefficient 𝑒prod,bat of 83.5 kg CO2−eq.∕kWh,
hich corresponds to the average value of the before mentioned range,
as selected for EV batteries.
As described in [48], vehicles’ WtW emissions 𝑒wtw approximately
orrespond to 2.83 kg CO2 − eq.∕L for gasoline, 3.18 kg CO2 − eq.∕L
or diesel, 1.83 kg CO2 − eq.∕L to 2.16 kg CO2 − eq.∕L for LPG and
2.39 kg CO2 − eq.∕kg to 2.96 kg CO2 − eq.∕kg for CNG. The value for
CBG from municipal waste is given with 0.749 kg CO2 − eq.∕kg by [49]
and the value for commercially available hydrogen (the majority is gray
hydrogen [50]) is given with 9.13 kg CO2 − eq.∕kg by [51]. Within the
scope of this paper, two different WtW emission values are considered
for electricity. First, the carbon intensity of the German power gen-
eration is considered, which corresponds to 0.401 kg CO2 − eq.∕kWh
according to [52]. Second, the carbon intensity of electricity produced
only from renewable energy sources is considered, which corresponds
to 0.003 kg CO2−eq.∕kWh to 0.068 kg CO2−eq.∕kWh according to [53].
For the LCA comparisons the average value of the carbon intensity
range is chosen, which corresponds to 0.036 kg CO2 − eq.∕kWh. Since
BEVs’ TtW emissions 𝑒ttw are zero, the WtT emissions 𝑒wtw correspond
to that of the electricity supply. Furthermore, to assess the total life-
cycle utilization emissions, vehicles’ lifetime must be specified. In
2019, the average distance German car drivers traveled per year was
about 14 610 km according to [54]. As issued by the German Federal
Motor Transport Authority in [55], about 3.6 million cars were newly
registered in 2019 and the total amount of registered passenger vehicles
increased from 47.1 million to about 47.7 million. Thus, with the values
from [54,55] it is valid to suggest an average vehicle lifetime 𝑆lifetime
of about 230 000 km, which corresponds to about 15.7 years.
In [56,57], the relative recycling emissions of vehicles’ body
𝑒recyc,body are approximated for a mid-size car, corresponding to
−2.33 kg CO2−eq.∕kg and −3.52 kg CO2−eq.∕kg, respectively. This corre-
sponds to an average recycling coefficient 𝑒recyc,body of −2.93 kg CO2 −
eq.∕kg. The relative battery recycling emissions 𝑒recyc,bat of the BEVs
eviewed in [56,57] approximately correspond to −41.1 kg CO2−eq.∕kg
and −55.7 kg CO2 − eq.∕kg, respectively. Thus, the average value of
he recycling coefficients presented in [56,57] is chosen in here, corre-
ponding to −48.4 kg CO2−eq.∕kg. In Table 1, the emission coefficients5
eviewed before are given.4. Results and discussion
This section presents and discusses the obtained total CO2-eq. life-
cycle emissions of the 790 vehicle variants based on the modeling
approaches introduced in Section 2, including the emission parameters
reviewed in Section 3, and the vehicle database itself. Furthermore, it
discusses this study’s results, problems and practical implications.
4.1. Total life-cycle emission comparison of mid-size car selection
At first, within this subsection, only a small selection of vehicles
from the database is considered. Furthermore, the vehicle production,
utilization, including the WtW, and recycling emissions are separately
quantified and compared. These small comparisons should transpar-
ently illustrate the chosen methodology before introducing the entire
results of the 790 vehicle variants in the subsequent subsections. For
this purpose, an example selection of several vehicles from the mid-
size sedan sector (D-segment) is chosen. This vehicle class offers all
included energy sources, apart from LPG, and the vehicle chassis as
well as the peak motor power ratings are comparable. Moreover, the
selected vehicle variants give a good general representation of vehicles’
life-cycle GHG emissions relative to different powertrains and energy
sources. The selected vehicle variants and their required parameters
for the emission calculations are given in Table 2. With these values,
the overall GHG emissions can be calculated as described before in
Section 2. The bar chart in Fig. 3 depicts the obtained total CO2-eq. life-
cycle emissions and, as can be seen, it is distinguished between the
production, utilization and recycling emissions.
Considering the production emissions of the selected gasoline vehi-
cle, a Volkswagen Passat 2.0 TSI, as a baseline, it can be noticed that
the selected diesel vehicle, Mercedes-Benz C 300 d, and the CNG/CBG
vehicle, Audi A4 40 g-tron, are characterized by a similar amount
of production emissions. Their production emissions differ from the
baseline by −1.1% and 0.7%, respectively, due to the vehicles’ mostly
similar body and drivetrain. The obtained production emission values
for the selected electrified vehicles, such as the FCEV (Toyota Mirai),
gasoline PHEV (VW Passat 1.4 TSI GTE) and diesel PHEV (Mercdes-
Benz C 300 de) are increased by 17%, 15% and 35%, respectively.
Since the FCEV is equipped with only a small Li-Ion battery and the
fuel cell system is not considered in detail, its production emissions
are relatively low compared to other EVs. The gasoline PHEV’s small
increase in production emissions compared to the similarly sized ICEV
can be explained by the fact that although an emission-intensive Li-
Ion battery is included, the conventional internal combustion engine is
replaced by a smaller, lighter and less powerful version. Since the diesel
PHEV’s internal combustion engine is the same as the diesel ICEV’s,
the production emission surplus is significantly higher in comparison.
Comparing the BEV (Tesla Model 3 SP) to the baseline vehicle, its
production emissions are increased by 49%. This difference equals
about 1294 L of fuel. With this amount, the gasoline car could travel
about 18 000 km (one year and three months). Due to the battery system,
the GHG emissions required for the production of the selected BEV are
typically higher than those of the combustion engine, hydrogen and
PHEV vehicles depicted in Fig. 3. The influence of the battery capacity
on the production emissions can be recognized, because PHEVs have
smaller batteries than BEVs and, thus, emit less GHG during production.
In contrast, the combined share of the selected BEV’s production
and utilization emissions is significantly reduced in comparison to that
of the Volkswagen Passat 2.0 TSI (gasoline), Mercedes-Benz C 300 d
(diesel) or the Audi A4 40 g-tron (CNG). From Fig. 3 it becomes
clear that the largest amount of the GHG emissions results from the
vehicle utilization in almost all cases. Only the utilization emissions
from the CBG vehicle and the BEV, when recharged with renewable
energy exclusively, are relatively small compared to their production
emissions.

HG during driving than vehicles utilizing renewable energy sources,
ncluding CBG. In addition, the comparison shows that hybrid and fully
lectrified vehicles significantly reduce the utilization emissions.
The recycling emissions differ between the vehicles in a similar
elation as the production emissions. For example, in addition to the
ecycling of the vehicle chassis and body parts, the recycling of PHEVs’
r BEVs’ batteries results in a large amount of extra GHG savings. Since
attery recycling is currently not as efficient as the recycling of other6
vehicle parts, the emission savings at vehicle recycling relative to the
production emissions are smaller for EVs.
4.2. Total life-cycle emissions relative to vehicle curb weight
Due to the rolling and drag resistance forces, it is clear that heav-
ier and larger vehicles consume more energy/fuel than lighter ones,
which in turn results in higher driving emissions [58]. Additionally,
since more material is needed for producing heavier vehicles, the

production emissions are increased as well. The increased emission
savings through the vehicle recycling cannot counterbalance the before
mentioned aspects. To illustrate this effect, Fig. 4 depicts the total life-
cycle emissions of the 790 vehicle variants relative to their vehicle
curb weight. The mid-size cars selected in Section 4.1 are indicated
by arrow labels. All emissions values are purposefully normalized
(𝐸life,tot∕𝑆lifetime[g/km]), because relative emissions values are com-
only used for consumer information materials and the assessment
asis for vehicle emission regulations. To illustrate the influence of
he production emission deviation, for example due the location, the
emi-transparent areas mark the possible best (61.6 kg CO2 − eq.∕kWh)
nd worst case (106.0 kg CO2 − eq.∕kWh) scenarios. Moreover, for each
ndividual energy source category, an emission function relative to the
ehicle curb weight 𝑚veh is mathematically fitted, so that the distinct
rends are easily visible. For the curve fitting, a quadratic equation with
he form according to
life,tot (𝑚veh) = 𝑎 ⋅ 𝑚2
veh + 𝑏 ⋅ 𝑚veh + 𝑐 (9)
s used, with 𝑎, 𝑏 and 𝑐 being the coefficients to be estimated/fitting
oefficients. In Table 3, the parameterized values of the coefficients
or each individual energy source can be found. From Fig. 4, it can
e seen that ICEVs generally emit more GHG than electrified vehicles.
specially, heavy gasoline vehicles, such as Sport Utility Vehicles, have
very high individual impact on the overall emissions of vehicle fleets.
PG vehicles show a similar relation, whereas diesel and CNG vehi-
les generally produce slightly less emissions than gasoline vehicles.
evertheless, when refueling CNG vehicles with CBG, the total lifetime
missions can be reduced by about 65%. Electrified vehicles such as
CEVs, PHEVs and BEVs emit significantly less GHGs during their
ifetime than their respective ICEV counterparts even if recharged with
onventional electricity. When recharging with renewable electricity
nly, additional emission savings of up to 70% over the entire vehicle’s
ife-cycle can be achieved. When comparing FCEVs to ICEVs, a signifi-
ant reduction in CO2-eq. emissions can be seen, despite the nature of
ydrogen’s production from natural gas.
Based on the obtained results, a conclusion can be drawn that BEVs
nd CNG/CBG vehicles achieve the lowest total life-cycle emissions
hen exclusively charged with green electricity and refueled only
ith biogas, respectively. Despite the fact that electrified vehicles, in
eneral, are heavier than conventional vehicles due to the extra weight
f the Li-Ion batteries and, in the case of PHEVs, the additional electric
otors, these typically achieve higher life-cycle emission savings than
CEVs. Only when comparing light, and thus small, ICEVs with heavy
Vs or PHEVs, no emission savings can be achieved if renewable
lectricity is not available.
.3. Total life-cycle emissions relative to peak motor power
Generally, heavier vehicles require an increased peak motor power
o reach dynamic driving characteristics similar to city, small or com-
act cars. Therefore, vehicle manufacturers equip heavier vehicles with7

more powerful drivetrains, as illustrated in Fig. 5 showing the rated
peak motor power 𝑃veh,max of the 790 vehicle variants relative to the
ehicle curb weight 𝑚veh. The mid-size cars selected in Section 4.1 are
ndicated by arrow labels. It can be seen that none of the commercially
vailable vehicles with a curb weight of less than 1000 kg has a power
ating of more than 100 kW. All vehicles with a higher power rating
han 200 kW have a vehicle curb weight of at least 1400 kg. Additionally,
here are no vehicles with a lower power than 100 kW that have a
igher curb weight than 1800 kg. The vast majority of vehicles weighs
ore than 2000 kg and has a peak motor power of more than 200 kW.
urthermore, it can be seen that gasoline vehicles have the highest
ower-to-weight ratio as long as the curb-weight does not exceed
000 kg. For higher curb weights, the power-to-weight ratio of BEVs
nd PHEVs is comparable to that of gasoline vehicles.
Considering these results, it can be seen that vehicles with a higher
eak motor power have an increased curb weight and, hence, these
onsume more fuel/energy [58]. Thus, it becomes obvious that com-
ercially available vehicles with a high power rating emit more GHG
han those with a lower power rating. To depict this relation, Fig. 6

s determined, with 𝑎, 𝑏 and 𝑐 being the coefficients to be estimated/
itting coefficients. In Table 4, the parameterized values of the coeffi-
ients for each individual energy source are listed.
It can be seen that the emission-power effect is more pronounced
derivative of 𝐸life,tot (𝑃veh,max) is higher) for ICEVs than for BEVs. For
xample, the coefficient 𝑏 shows that the derivative of the emission-
ower ratio of gasoline vehicles is about three to six times higher than
hat of BEVs when recharged with conventional and renewable elec-
ricity respectively. Furthermore, Fig. 6 shows that the GHG emissions
f BEVs, when recharged with conventional electricity, correspond to
alf (for 𝑃veh,max < 100 kW) down to a third (for 𝑃veh,max ≈ 500 kW) of
hose of ICEVs. When exclusively recharged with green electricity, the
missions are even reduced by a factor of 10 (for 𝑃veh,max < 100 kW)
o 15 (for 𝑃veh,max ≈ 500 kW). This relation can be explained by the
act that ICEVs in comparison to BEVs and PHEVs do not have the
ossibility to utilize regenerative braking, which converts the kinetic
nergy of the vehicle back to electrical energy. Additionally, the WLTP
fficiency of a combustion engine (≈30% [59]) is significantly lower
han that of an electric drivetrain (>90% [60,61]).
.4. Problems in data acquisition and comparability
During the acquisition of the vehicle data, several problems were
ncountered, which are described in the following paragraphs. For
he calculation of the production and recycling emissions, the vehicle
urb weight and the battery gross capacity have been primarily used.
owever, manufacturers often do not provide the data in a globallytandardized form. Thus, they either provide the German Institute for
Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 159 (2022) 112158J. Buberger et al.Fig. 4. Normalized CO2-eq. life-cycle emissions relative to the vehicle curb weight.Fig. 5. Peak motor power relative to the vehicle curb weight.Standardization (DIN) (car with all the fluids necessary for operation,
including a 90% full tank of fuel) or EU standard value (DIN figure plus
75 kg for the driver) for the vehicle curb weight. Furthermore, vehicle
manufactures might publicly use the battery net instead of the gross
capacity, since it is of more interest for the consumer. Therefore, inad-
equate and missing vehicle data had to be adapted or accumulated from
sources like car magazines’, websites or online forums. Additionally, it8
is not clear how the supply chains differ between vehicle manufacturers
and different vehicles produced by the same car brand. Moreover, the
actual manufacturing location of each vehicle as well as the origin of
the battery cells and raw materials can have an impact on vehicles of
the same type. Since only the most basic configuration of each vehicle
has been considered for the comparisons, all additional equipment was
neglected. For example, this means that the production emissions of
Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 159 (2022) 112158J. Buberger et al.Fig. 6. Normalized CO2-eq. life-cycle emissions relative to the peak motor power.luxury vehicle versions’ leather seats, cameras, Radio Detection And
Ranging (RADAR) and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) sensors,
different transmission options, all-wheel-drive systems, etc. were not
necessarily included in the calculations.
Furthermore, the emissions associated with the fuel production and
provisioning can strongly differ depending on the location. Especially,
the emissions values for CBG or hydrogen in comparison to fossil
fuels can significantly differ. This is due to the reason that there are
multiple profitable production techniques for CBG and hydrogen, which
have different climate change impacts. Similarly to these alternative
fuels, the WtT emissions of gasoline and diesel caused by crude oil
production, shipping and refining are subject to the location of the
processes. Since most countries obtain their fuels from a variety of
different locations, an averaged value is used in this study. Further
detailing of each individual fuel’s WtT emissions exceeds the scope of
this paper.
Generally, the large-scale availability of certain energy sources was
also not extensively considered within the scope of this paper. For
instance, CNG/CBG fueling stations are available in most parts of
Europe, but these are still rare in comparison to LPG stations. Both LPG
and CNG vehicle types are usually suitable for bivalent usage, which
means that they have an additional gasoline tank to extend their driving
range. However, the utilization of small amounts of gasoline has not
been taken into account for these vehicles within the study presented
here. Although CBG powered vehicles produce significantly less GHG
emissions in comparison to ICEVs, the sustainable supply of biogas is
limited to the available amount of manure, waste, etc. Moreover, the
emissions produced by cattle farming, from which the manure partially
originates for biogas production, are not included in this calculation
since only the waste products are used.
Due to the usage of the UF for PHEVs, the WLTP energy consump-
tion values are potentially more inaccurate compared to the real-world
consumption of other vehicle types. The WLTP values suggest that
PHEVs are recharged almost daily, because of their limited electric
driving range, which is not possible for many vehicle owners/drivers.
Additionally, manufacturers typically provide the fossil fuel consump-
tion of PHEVs, whereas the electric energy consumption might be9
omitted because it is not part of any CO2 emission regulations. How-
ever, for this study, this aspect was crucial for the proper calculation
of the WtW emissions from PHEVs.
Currently, only two different FCEVs are available for purchase on
the market. Reliable studies on fuel cells’ production emissions are yet
to be published. Especially, since the effects of mass production cannot
be foreseen at the moment, the production emissions associated with
the fuel cell itself are neglected within the scope of this paper. However,
the emissions caused by the small traction battery used in FCEVs
are included in the calculations underlying the vehicles’ production
emissions.
4.5. Discussion and practical implications
The results obtained from this study show that although electrified
vehicles produce more GHG during their production due to the energy
intensive production of the Li-Ion batteries, their overall lifetime GHG
emissions are lower compared to conventional vehicles. When used
with renewable energies, their emissions can be further reduced. As
expected, the total life-cycle GHG emissions are strongly dependent on
the vehicles’ curb weight. As shown in Fig. 4 this dependence can be
described as a quadratic function for ICEVs and as a linear function for
EVs, respectively. This can be explained by EVs’ ability to regenerate
some of the energy used to accelerate the vehicle when braking. While
with ICEVs the production emissions as well as the fuel consumption
increase with weight, this is only the case for production emissions
with EVs. A similar phenomenon can be experienced with the emissions
dependent on peak motor power. Here, the dependence is mostly linear
for ICEVs while it is negatively quadratic for EVs. This can be explained
by the fact that EVs with higher peak motor power tend to be more
sporty and aerodynamic vehicles which therefore use less energy and
produce less GHG emissions during utilization. The sensitivity analy-
sis for different battery production emissions additionally shows that
battery production only has a small impact on the total life-cycle GHG
emissions of a vehicle.
Comparing these results to other recent studies, similarities can be
noticed. Comparing the production emissions from the single vehicle
Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 159 (2022) 112158J. Buberger et al.comparison to the results obtained from [14], it can be seen that
there are hardly any deviations within the results. The total life-cycle
emissions are lower for the ICEV in [14], because only 200.000 km of
total traveled distance until decommissioning were included into the
calculation. However, the BEV’s total GHG emissions are lower in this
study since it was assumed that the battery pack can be used until
the vehicle’s EoL. The results on vehicle production emissions obtained
by [17] are also similar to this study. The relative difference between
the BEV’s and the ICEV’s production emissions is 59% compared to 49%
in this study. As stated by [26], the production emissions contribute
to vehicles’ total GHG emissions by 10% in the case of an ICEV and
by 40% in the case of a BEV, respectively. These values are similar to
this study’s results for ICEVs, which are 15 to 19%. BEVs, however,
emit 58% of their life-cycle emissions during production if conventional
electricity is used. The differences can be explained mainly by the
used drive cycles and total traveled distance as well as the electricity’s
composition. Comparing the findings in [5] to this study, it becomes
clear that the results in the single vehicle comparison are realistic.
Although a different vehicle category and total distance traveled was
considered, BEVs generally emit the lowest amount of GHG. PHEVs
and vehicles with alternative fuels are comparable to each other while
gasoline and diesel ICEVs emit the highest amount of GHG. Since the
total distance traveled was presumed to be only 150.000 km in [5], the
emissions per km are overall higher compared to this study.
Generally, the obtained results can be used to approximate the
individual GHG emissions from a certain passenger car compared to
other vehicles. This is possible for most of the currently, commercially
available vehicles in Europe but also for similar vehicles in other mar-
kets. The results from this study can help consumers to choose the right
vehicle for their personal use if GHG emissions are an important influ-
ence on the decision. Furthermore, companies can estimate the impact
on their GHG emissions when changing their vehicle fleet from conven-
tional vehicles to vehicles with alternative powertrains. However, the
calculations within this study only apply to the chosen values for the
specific emissions, fuel consumption measured in the WLTP cycle and
for 230.000 km of total traveled distance until decommissioning. The
real-world emissions strongly depend on these parameters and need
to be adapted to the vehicles’ specific application case. Furthermore,
vehicles with hybrid powertrains or multiple possible fuels such as
CNG/CBG/LPG vehicles produce a variable amount of GHG during
utilization dependent on the actually used fuel or energy source.
5. Conclusion and future outlook
This paper has dealt with the modeling and quantification of the
total CO2-eq. life-cycle emissions from a broad selection of commer-
cially available passenger cars with different powertrains and energy
sources. In total, 790 different vehicle variants are considered. The
total life-cycle emissions are divided into the production, utilization
and recycling emissions. Thus, this paper provides comprehensive and
holistic comparisons of vehicles’ GHG emissions.
The results show that the combined sum of the production and re-
cycling emission values (absolute) of gasoline, diesel and CNG vehicles
are small in comparison to the utilization emissions (<33%). For exam-
ple, the obtained utilization emissions of a Volkwagen Passat 2.0 TSI
(gasoline) correspond to 46 865 kg CO2-eq., whereas the production and
recycling emissions are about 7538 kg CO2-eq. and −4843 kg CO2-eq.,
respectively. The additional production emissions of similarly sized
PHEVs compared to classical combustion engine vehicles vary from
15% to 37%, while for BEVs, the production emissions are increased
by about 49%. For example, the additional production emissions of
a Tesla Model 3 SP approximately correspond to the driving emis-
sions of a Volkwagen Passat 2.0 TSI after 18 000 km. Similar results
have been obtained for the vehicle recycling emissions, which have
a positive climate change impact (emission saving). These counter-
balance the climate change impact of the production emissions by a10large extent (60% to 65%). Compared to gasoline powered cars, diesel
vehicles can reduce the utilization emissions by 24%, CNG vehicles
by 49%, FCEVs by 65%, gasoline PHEVs by 58%, diesel PHEVs by
41% and BEVs by 72%, when using conventional electricity (Ger-
many; 0.401 kg CO2 − eq.∕kWh). When exclusively refueling with CBG
or recharging with green electricity, the emissions savings are 86% for
the CBG vehicle, 79% for the gasoline PHEV, 75% for the diesel PHEV
and 97% for the BEV.
Overall, it has been shown that vehicles with higher curb weight
produce more GHG emissions both during production and utilization
(as well as in total). For vehicles with combustion engines, this corre-
lation can be approximated with a quadratic function while it is rather
linear for electrified vehicles. Considering the total vehicle life-cycle
emissions relative to the peak motor power, a linear correlation has
been observed. Nonetheless, the observed gradients for ICEVs is larger
than those for BEVs. For example, the GHG emissions of BEVs in com-
parison to ICEVs are reduced by a factor of 10 (for 𝑃veh,max < 100 kW)
to 15 (for 𝑃veh,max ≈ 500 kW), when exclusively recharged with green
electricity.
Summarizing the key-results; it has been shown that BEVs produce
the lowest amount of total life-cycle emissions, especially when using
electricity produced from renewable energy sources. Up until today,
the majority of commercially available hydrogen is produced from
natural gas, which worsens the actual climate change impact of FCEVs
in comparison to BEVs (using green electricity). The GHG emissions
emitted by FCEVs are lower than those of CNG vehicles. Nevertheless,
when fueled with CBG, the utilization emissions of CNG vehicles can
be significantly reduced.
Based on the mentioned results, the following major conclusions
can be drawn. Fully electrified vehicles, such as BEVs and FCEVs,
and biogas powered gas vehicles should be the favored solutions for
vehicle owners. It is important that the used electricity, hydrogen and
biogas is produced in sustainable and environmentally friendly ways,
which might be economically difficult for biogas and hydrogen when
considering a larger scale.
Since fossil energy sources will likely lose parts of their current
market share, in a future work updated emission values need to be used
for all calculations. This could lead to a larger production of biofuels
and, thus, ICEVs could become more competitive to EVs again, as for
example shown by CBG vehicles in this study. A future version of this
study could also increase the complexity of the acquired data. Through
a potential usage of the official vehicle registration statistics, the num-
ber of different vehicles can be increased. Potentially, emissions caused
by vehicle development could be estimated by the sales figures as well
as the country’s energy mix in which the development took place.
In Addition to an overall larger quantity of different vehicles, the
production locations could be used to estimate the GHG emissions
of the respective supply chains. In the course of this, for each EV,
the production location of the batteries can be used to determine the
exact production emissions. All the necessary data can be acquired
by governmental organizations like the German Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt.
Since the real-world fuel consumption or real driving emissions of every
vehicle must be provided by vehicle manufacturers in the future, the
accuracy of the results, especially for PHEVs (no UF would be required
any longer), could be improved.
As previously mentioned in 4.4, there were some problems to be
faced by this study which can be solved within future works. LCA
generally has its limitations as stated by [62]. Accordingly, energy
and exergy analyses can be used as an alternative to LCA in future
publications. Especially exergoenvironmental analyses, such as per-
formed in [63] on different bioenergy systems, could be performed on
passenger vehicles and their individual energy sources.
