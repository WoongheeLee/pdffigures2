To fulfil the aim of carbon neutrality, expanding the scale of renewable energy utilization is necessary. Hydrogen 
is considered as the future of green energy because it is not only a carbon-free fuel, but also a good energy storage 
medium for renewables. In this work, a renewable energy utilization model including photovoltaic module, 
electrolyzer module, and fuel cell module, is developed to simulate the performance of hydrogen production and 
power generation system. The influences of solar radiation intensity and ambient temperature on the perfor-
mance and efficiency of the system are investigated and the results show that the system efficiency firstly in-
creases but then decreases as solar radiation intensity rises. However, the system efficiency shows a 
monotonically decreasing trend with higher ambient temperature. The calculated efficiency of the system is 
about 6%–7% under different environmental conditions. In addition, the feasibility and benefits of the system in 
Tianjin, China, are studied, combined with the meteorological conditions in the area such as daily solar radiation 
and average temperature. The system can generate above 4100 kWh of electricity during one year within an area 
of 28 m2 photovoltaic array, which can almost meet 70% of the annual electricity demand of one household.   
1. Introduction 
Renewable energy, such as solar and wind, is widely available and 
environmentally friendly [1–3]. To cope with the depletion of fossil 
energy and global environmental pollution, expanding the scale of 
renewable energy utilization is necessary [4–7]. However, the power 
generated by renewable energy directly connecting to the power grid 
will bring about power quality problems such as voltage and frequency 
fluctuations [8,9], since renewable energy, especially solar and wind, is 
characterized by severe random fluctuation and intermittence in 
different time of a day, seasons and climates [10]. Therefore, in order to 
fully develop and utilize renewable energy, it is necessary to cooperate 
with the energy storage system [11]. Hydrogen is considered as the 
green energy of the 21st century because it is not only a clean and 
carbon-free fuel, but also a good energy storage medium for renewables 
[12,13]. When renewable sources are sufficient, hydrogen can be 
generated by electrolyzer with renewable energy under electrochemical 
reaction [14–16], and the produced hydrogen can be used to generate 
electricity through fuel cell [17]. The renewable energy utilization 
system can be developed through a combination of renewable sources, 
electrolyzer, hydrogen storage device, and fuel cell [18,19]. 
In the previous literature, many investigations were conducted 
focusing on the renewable energy utilization, including performance 
and efficiency analysis, comparison of different configurations, and the 
feasibility of the system for specific areas. Dawood et al. [20] proposed 
that storing renewable energy by electrolyzing water to produce 
hydrogen is the most potential scheme to achieve a completely renew-
able and sustainable economy. Belmonte et al. [21] made a comparison 
of different renewable energy storage methods and the results revealed 
that the hydrogen technology had the lowest burdens from the envi-
ronmental point of view. Peláez et al. [22] performed a techno-economic 
assessment for a hybrid PV-FC system and they concluded that the sys-
tem was technically possible. Gibson et al. [23,24] evaluated the per-
formance of the photovoltaic-driven electrolyzer system for hydrogen 
production and it showed that the efficiency of the hybrid system could 
be optimized to 12.4%, but the work did not present a compete con-
version process from solar energy to electric energy. Bensmail et al. [25] 
developed a hybrid photovoltaic/fuel cell system model and analyzed 
the control strategy and power management of the system. In this work, 
the main components models including electrolyzer and fuel cell were 
simplified to equivalent circuit model, and they were not validated by 
experimental results. So, it was difficult to calculate the system

efficiency quantitatively. Many studies [26–28] were conducted 
focusing on the coupling of PV array to electrolyzer in the system from 
experimental and simulation perspectives and drew a conclusion that 
direct coupling of the two components could lead to substantial cost 
reduction and higher efficiency. Ganguly et al. [29] and Bahtiyar et al. 
[30] conducted techno-economic analysis of hybrid renewable energy 
system to supply the electrical load requirements of a greenhouse and 
nursing home for different climatic conditions respectively, both of 
which proved the feasibility of the hybrid photovoltaic/fuel cell system 
for stand-alone applications. Abdollahipour et al. [9] numerically 
simulated and then optimized the micro-renewable energy system 
including fuel cell and electrolyzer in terms of power output, efficiency, 
and levelized cost of electricity. However, the hydrogen storage was not 
considered in this work. Sharma et al. [31] and Dursun et al. [32] 
evaluated the hydrogen production capacity of renewable hybrid power 
systems in India and Istanbul respectively, and the results showed that 
the performance of the system highly depended on the local climate 
conditions. Abdullah et al. [33] and Mokheimer et al. [34] presented 
simulations and optimizations for different hybrid renewable power 
generation systems with different configurations and covered global 
locations including Saudi Arabia, Toronto and Sydney. They concluded 
that the system consisting of fuel cell, electrolyzer and hydrogen tank 
was possible and environmentally friendly although the investment was 
high. However, in these two studies, the efficiencies of the main com-
ponents were fixed, which neglected the inner physical phenomena and 
significant influence of the system configurations as well as operating 
conditions. 
There are two major deficiencies in the previous research: few lit-
eratures considered the complete energy conversion process of renew-
able energy like turning solar energy into electric energy; the models of 
main components including electrolyzer and fuel cell were based on 
empirical equation or equivalent circuit model that simplified certain 
physical and electrochemical processes, which neglected the changes in 
component performance and efficiency when the external environ-
mental condition changed. 
In this study, a renewable energy utilization system composed of 
photovoltaic module, electrolyzer module and fuel cell module is 
developed for hydrogen production and power generation, which can 
realize the energy conversion process from solar energy to hydrogen 
energy and then to electric energy without carbon and pollutant emis-
sion. The physical models of electrolyzer and fuel cell are proposed 
considering the complex mass transfer process and certain electro-
chemical process. In addition, the main components including 
photovoltaic cell, electrolyzer and fuel cell are validated under various 
operating conditions. Then the influence of operating parameters and 
environmental conditions on the performance and efficiency of the 
components and the system are analyzed. Moreover, the feasibility and 
benefits of the system in Tianjin, China, are investigated according to the 
meteorological conditions in the area. 
2. Methodology 
The system consists of photovoltaic arrays, electrolyzer cells, high- 
pressure gas storage tanks, fuel cells, converters, compressors, and 
auxiliary parts, as shown in Fig. 1. When the solar energy is sufficient, it 
is converted into electric energy by the photovoltaic module, and then 
the electric energy is transmitted to the electrolyzer. Driven by the direct 
current, the electrolyzer splits water into hydrogen and oxygen under 
electrochemical reaction. The produced hydrogen and oxygen are then 
compressed by compressor and stored in high-pressure gas storage 
tanks, and the power the compressor consumes is provided by the 
electricity generated from photovoltaic module. Finally, the produced 
hydrogen and oxygen are introduced to the fuel cell module, and the 
chemical energy is converted into electric energy. It should be noticed 
that in the system, the electricity produced by the photovoltaic module 
and fuel cell module is direct current and needs to be converted to the 
alternative current by converters before supplying to the users. 
2.1. Photovoltaic cell modeling 
The photovoltaic cell (PV) is a semiconductor device that directly 
converts solar energy into electric energy [35]. The mathematical model 
of the photovoltaic cell is expressed as [36]:

where I and Vrepresent the current and voltage of the cell respectively; 
ISC and Im denote the short-circuit current and maximum-power current 
respectively; VOC and Vm mean the open-circuit voltage and maximum- 
power voltage respectively; C1 and C2 are two intermediate variables.

where T represents the temperature of the photovoltaic cell under actual 
solar radiation intensity; Tair is the ambient temperature; K means the 
temperature coefficient of the photovoltaic cell when the solar radiation 
intensity changes; S denotes the solar radiation intensity; Tref and Sref are 
the reference temperature and reference solar radiation intensity 
respectively; Vref

power voltage, short-circuit current and maximum-power current 
under reference environmental conditions respectively; a, b, and c refer 
to material related constants. The photovoltaic cell properties are pro-
vided in Table 1. 
The incremental conductance maximum power point tracking algo-
rithm is adopted in this study to realize the tracking of the maximum 
power point output of the photovoltaic module [4,37]. 
2.2. Electrolyzer modeling 
Hydrogen production from water electrolysis is an important 
hydrogen production method, whose advantages lie in the high purity of 
the produced hydrogen and high compatibility with other renewable 
energy sources [38]. In proton exchange membrane electrolyzer 
(PEME), water is fed to the anode, and decomposes into oxygen gas, 
protons and electrons driven by required electricity. The produced 
protons are transported to the cathode through the membrane, while the 
electrons move to the cathode through the external circuit driven by 
external voltage. Inside the cathode, protons combine with electrons to 
form hydrogen gas. The oxygen generated in the anode and the 
hydrogen generated in the cathode are transported into the flow channel 
by the porous electrode and then discharged from the electrolyzer [39].  
1) Mass transfer 
The material balance equations for the anode and cathode are: 
O2 at Anode: 
nO2 =
I
4F
(11) 
H2O at Anode: 
nano
H2O = nmem

H2 at cathode: 
nH2 =
I
2F
(13) 
H2O at cathode: 
ncat
H2O = nmem
H2O (14)  
where nO2 represents the oxygen flux in the anode; I is current density; F 
means Faraday constant; nano
H2O and ncat
H2O refer to the water flux in the 
anode and cathode respectively; nmem
H2O is the flux of water through the 
membrane; nH2 means the hydrogen flux in the cathode. 
Water crossover through the membrane is driven by three mecha-
nisms: hydraulic permeation by the liquid pressure difference between 
the anode and cathode, membrane water diffusion, and electro-osmotic 
drag effect: 
nmem
H2O = ndiff
H2O + nEOD
H2O − nhp
H2O (15)  
where ndiff
H2O means the flux of water due to diffusion from anode to 
cathode; nEOD
H2O represents the flux of water from anode to cathode due to 
electro-osmotic drag and nhp
H2O is the flux of water from the cathode to the 
anode due to the pressure effect. 
The rate of water transport due to diffusion is calculated by inte-
grating Fick’s law of diffusion between the two membrane interfaces: 
ndiff
H2O =
Dmem
H2O
δmem
(

(16)  
where Dmem
H2O refers to the diffusion coefficient of water in the membrane; 
δmem is the membrane thickness and ccat
H2O,mem, can
H2O,memrepresent the 
water concentrations at the two sides of the membrane respectively. 
The electro-osmotic drag is directly related to the flux of protons 
moving from the anode to the cathode through the membrane and the 
molar flow rate can be expressed as 
nEOD
H2O =
ndI
F
(17)  
where nd represents the electro-osmotic drag coefficient. 
The rate of water transport due to diffusion from the cathode to the 
anode across the membrane relies on the pressure gradient and can be 
calculated by Darcy’s law: 
nhp
H2O =
KmemρH2O(pcat − pan)
δmemμH2OMH2O
(18)  
where Kmem denotes the membrane permeability of water; pan, pcat refer 
to the pressure of the anode and cathode respectively; μH2O is the vis-
cosity of water. The electrolyzer properties and operating conditions are 
provided in Table 2.  
2) Electrochemical model 
The required voltage for PEME can be expressed as 
V =Voc + Vact a + Vact c + Vcon a + Vcon c + Vohm (19)  
where V refers to the operating voltage; Voc represents the open-circuit 
voltage; Vact aand Vact c are the activation overpotentials at anode and 
cathode respectively; Vcon a and Vcon c are the concentration over-
potentials at anode and cathode respectively; Vohm means the ohmic 
overpotential. 
The open-circuit voltage can be derived from the Nernst equation for 
water electrolysis:

(20)  
where pH2 and pO2 are the partial pressures of hydrogen and oxygen 
respectively; R represents the universal gas constant; aH2O means the 
water activity between electrode and membrane (1 for liquid water). 
The activation overpotential is a representation of the electro-
chemical kinetic behavior and the electrode activation overpotential can 
be expressed by Butler-Volmer equation [40]:

(22)  
where αa and αc mean the charge transfer coefficients at the anode and 
cathode respectively; i0,a and i0,c denote the exchange current density at 
the anode and cathode respectively. 
The ohmic overpotential of the electrolyzer mainly includes losses 
caused by protons passing through the membrane as well as contact 
resistance and it can be evaluated according to ohm’s law: 
Vohm =
(
δmem
σmem
+Rcon
)
I (23)  
where Rcon means the contact resistance in the electrolyzer. 
The concentration overpotential represents the voltage loss caused 
by the process that the reactants reach the reaction sites as well as the 
products discharge from that. In PEME, the reactant is water, and the 
activity of liquid water is 1.0, so only the voltage loss caused by the 
discharge of the produced oxygen and hydrogen is considered:

electrode; cmem
O2 ,0 and cmem
H2 ,0 are the reference concentration of oxygen and 
hydrogen respectively. More detailed electrochemical and transport 
properties are given in Table 3.  
3) H2 production rate 
The hydrogen production rate can be calculated as: 
qH2 = ηF

(26)  
where A represents the reaction area of the electrolyzer; nc is the number 
of electrolyzer in series and ηF denotes the Faraday efficiency. 
2.3. Fuel cell modeling  
1) Electrochemical model 
As one of the most promising environmentally friendly and efficient 
power generation technologies, proton exchange membrane fuel cell 
(PEMFC) directly converts chemical energy stored in fuel and oxidant 
into electrical energy through electrochemical reaction [41–43]. In the 
fuel cell, the H2 and O2 are supplied in anode and cathode respectively to 
produce water and generate power at the same time. The H2 diffuses 
from the anode channel through the porous layer and finally reaches the 
Pt surface, the reaction site, where it generates protons and electrons. 
The produced protons are transported from the anode to the cathode 
through the membrane, while the electrons are transported to the 
cathode through the external circuit to react with the protons as well as 
O2, which diffuses from the cathode channel, to form water and generate 
current in the external circuit [44]. 
The output voltage of fuel cell can be calculated as: 
V =Erev − Vact a − Vact c − Vcon a − Vcon c − Vohm (27)  
where Erev represents the reversible voltage; Vact a and Vact c are the 
activation losses at anode and cathode, respectively; Vcon a and Vcon c 
refer to the concentration losses at anode and cathode respectively; Vohm 
is the ohmic loss.

The ohmic loss is caused by the transfer resistance of charge carriers 
when passing through the components, and it can be calculated by 
Ohm’s law: 
Vohm =Vohm,P +Vohm,por +Vohm,m =

plate, porous electrode and membrane respectively, I is the current

The activation loss provides the drive force for sustainable chemical 
reactions, and it can be evaluated by Tafel equation:

ated blocking the transport channel of gaseous reactants, which results

The hydrogen and air are fed to the anode and cathode flow channels 
respectively and the gases transport from the flow channel to the porous 
electrodes are driven by concentration gradient. The gas diffusion 
equation can be expressed by Fick’s law as: 
Ji = − Deff
i ∇Ci (32)  
where Ji represents the molar flux rate of gas species i, i represents the 
species of H2, O2 and vapor; Ci is the molar concentration of i; Deff
i refers 
to the effective diffusivity of i. 
In channel, the flux rate from channel to the electrode surface can be 
expressed by Sherwood number: 
Ji =
ShDi
(
Ci,ch − Ci,ch− gdl
)
Ac
Agdldh
(33)  
where Ci,ch and Ci,ch− gdl denote the concentrations of species i in the flow 
channel and on the electrode surface respectively; dh refers to the hy-
draulic diameter of channel; Ac and Agdl are the area of channel and gas 
diffusion layer respectively. 
The gases volume flow rates can be evaluated as: 
Vi =
IAactST
nFCi,in
(34)  
where Aact denotes the reaction area; ST refers to the stoichiometry 
ratio; Ci,in means the concentration at the channel inlet of gas species i, i 
represents the species of H2 and O2; n is 2 for H2 and 4 for O2, then the 
mass conservation equation of is obtained: 
IAactST
nF
=
IAact
nF
+ Ci,outVi (35) 
The reaction gases concentration in channel can be simplified as 
[45]: 
Ci,ch =
Ci,in + Ci,out

(36)  
where Ci,in and Ci,out represent the gas concentration at the inlet and 
outlet of channel respectively.  
3) Water transport 
In fuel cell, the transport of water in the ionomer of membrane and 
porous layer involves electro-osmotic drag (EOD), diffusion and hy-
draulic permeation. 
The total discharged net water of anode and cathode can be calcu-
lated as: 
Jnet,a = JH2O,back + JH2O,hyd − JH2O,EOD (37)  
Jnet,c =
I
2F
+ JH2O,EOD − JH2O,back − JH2O,hyd (38)  
where JH2O,EOD, JH2O,back and JH2O,hyd mean the water molar flux caused 
by EOD, diffusion and hydraulic permeation respectively. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Model validation 
In this section, the simulation results of the main components 
including photovoltaic cell, electrolyzer and fuel cell are compared with 
experimental data under different operating conditions.  
1) Photovoltaic cell Model validation 
The developed photovoltaic cell model is validated with the current- 
voltage curve of KC200GT provided by Kyocera at various conditions of 
solar radiations and different temperatures respectively. As shown in 
Fig. 2, when the voltage is fixed, the current going through the photo-
voltaic cell is proportional to the solar irradiance intensity while 
inversely proportional to the temperature especially when the voltage is 
above 20 V. Meanwhile, irradiance intensity plays a dominant role in the 
output current and power of the photovoltaic cell when both tempera-
ture and irradiance intensity change. The results show that the average 
error rate between simulation and experiment is 6.30% and this error 
rate is within the allowed range.  
2) Electrolyzer model validation 
As shown in Fig. 3, the calculated electrolyzer performance is 
compared with the experiments in Ref. [48] under different operating 
temperatures when the model parameters are consistent with the 
experimental cell, which are shown in Table 2, and a good agreement

between simulation and experimental results is achieved with the 
average error rate of 2.68%. It can be observed that the cell potential 
climbs rapidly when the current density is less than 0.3 A cm− 2. As the 
current density exceeds 0.3 A cm− 2, the cell potential grows steadily 
with it.  
3) Fuel cell model validation 
The developed fuel cell model is validated by the experimental po-
larization curve under various temperatures. The operating conditions 
and geometric structure of the fuel cell keep consistent with those in 
Ref. [49], which are presented in Table 4. As shown in Fig. 4, the 
simulation results reasonably agree with the experimental data and the 
average error rate between simulation and experiment is about 1.38%. 
In general, the performance of the fuel cell gradually improves as the 
operating temperature increases especially in high current density re-
gion. That is because as the operating temperature increases, the water 
content of saturated membrane rises and the ionic conductivity of the 
membrane drops, both of which lead to the decrease of ohmic loss. 
However, the partial pressure of vapor increases as the temperature 
rises, which results in that the partial pressure of the reactant gas de-
creases since the gas pressure is constant, so the concentration loss of the 
cell is more obvious. In all, the operating temperature has slight effect on 
the performance of the fuel cell, which is influenced by the ohmic loss as 
well as the concentration loss. 
3.2. Effects of operating conditions on the performance of electrolyzer and 
fuel cell  
1) Effects of operating temperature, cathode pressure and membrane 
thickness on electrolyzer 
As shown in Fig. 5(b)-(f), the electrolyzer cell potential decreases as 
operating temperature increases since the electrochemical reaction is 
faster under higher temperature, resulting in a higher exchange current 
density and a lower activation overpotential, which is consistent with 
the results shown in Fig. 3. What is more, the ionic conductivity of the 
membrane increases with temperature, and it contributes to the 
decrease of ohmic overpotential. The cathode activation overpotential 
under different temperatures has little difference, and so does the con-
centration overpotential. In other words, the combined effects of acti-
vation overpotential and ohmic overpotential reduction contribute to a 
significant drop in cell potential. In addition, the required cell voltage 
reduces as the operating temperature rises, which leads to a reduced 
power input and a higher efficiency of the electrolyzer, as shown in 
Fig. 5(a). Moreover, it can be found that the energy efficiency decreases 
with current density since the electrical power provided to the electro-
lyzer climbs with the current density, which is faster than the increase of 
H2 production. 
Fig. 6(a) indicates the relationship between the current density and 
the input cell potential under different conditions of cathode pressure. 
On the one hand, increasing the cathode pressure can improve the 
concentration of hydrogen produced, but on the other hand it also in-
creases the concentration overpotential at the cathode, resulting in the 
rise in the voltage required by the electrolyzer at the same current 
density. 
Generally, the membrane thickness of a PEME ranges from 50 μm to 
200 μm. Fig. 6(b) illustrates the influence of membrane thickness on the 
performance of the electrolyzer. It can be revealed that the membrane 
thickness has little effect on the cell potential when the current density is 
less than 0.2 A cm-2. With the rise of the current density, the cell po-
tential is found to increase with membrane thickness more apparantly 
since the membrane ionic resistance rises with the membrane thickness, 
which leads to the increase of the ohmic overpotential as well as the 
input cell voltage.  
2) Effects of inlet pressure and stoichiometric ratio on fuel cell 
Fig. 7(a) illustrates that the cell performance varies with the anode 
and cathode inlet pressures, and the anode and cathode inlet pressures 
keep consistent. With the increase of inlet pressure, the limiting current 
density of the cell increases, which leads to the decrease of concentra-
tion loss and the improved cell performance. However, when the inlet 
pressure increases to a certain extent, the degree of improvement of cell 
performance decreases. In all, the higher the inlet pressure, the better 
the cell performance, but increasing inlet pressure will generate addi-
tional energy consumption and add to the operating cost of the system, 
thus reducing the efficiency of the system. 
The stoichiometric ratio represents the relationship between the 
actual supply of reactant gas and the reaction rate. The larger the stoi-
chiometric ratio, the more sufficient the cell reactant gas. In this study, 
four different working conditions are selected to investigate the per-
formance of fuel cell under the conditions of different stoichiometric 
ratios of cathode and anode reactant gases. 
As shown in Fig. 7(b), the cell performance improves significantly

simulation results and experimental data [48].

sults and experimental data [49].

when the cathode stoichiometric ratio increases from 1.0 to 2.0, whereas 
the anode stoichiometric ratio remains unchanged since the larger the 
cathode stoichiometric ratio, the higher the oxygen gas concentration, 
resulting in the improvement of limiting current density and the 
decrease of the concentration loss of the cell. When the stoichiometric 
ratio of the cathode remains constant while the stoichiometric ratio of 
the anode increases from 1.0 to 2.0, the cell performance has little 
change, which reflects that the concentration loss of the cell mainly 
results from the oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode. Therefore, 
sufficient gas supply of the cathode is needed to attain a high perfor-
mance of the fuel cell. 
3.3. Effects of environmental conditions on system 
The input energy of the system is the solar energy absorbed by the 
photovoltaic array, which is affected by environmental factors such as 
temperature, solar radiation intensity and so on. Thus, the hydrogen 
production, power generation and efficiency of the system all change 
with environmental conditions. This study investigates the effects of 
solar radiation intensity and ambient temperature on the performance of 
the photovoltaic-electrolyzer-fuel cell system. 
As illustrated in Fig. 8(a), when the ambient temperature is set at 
25 ◦C, as the increase of the solar radiation intensity from 0 to 1200 W

m− 2, both the absorbed power and the efficiency of the photovoltaic 
module rise considerably. Therefore, Fig. 8(b) indicates that more en-
ergy transmits to the electrolyzer module and the operating current of 
the electrolyzer increases, leading to the decrease of efficiency and 
higher H2 production, which is consistent with the trend in Fig. 5(a). The 
efficiency of the fuel cell is related to the application conditions, and a 
steady-state condition with an efficiency of 60.4% is selected in this 
study. Converters play a key role in processing the power flow of the 
system. The efficiency of the typical DC/AC converters is about 90%. 
Fig. 8(c) illustrates that the efficiency of the photovoltaic-electrolyzer- 
fuel cell system firstly increases with the solar radiation intensity from 
nearly 6.1% to 6.6% since the efficiency of the photovoltaic module 
grows slightly from 13% to 15% when the solar radiation intensity rises 
from 0 to 500 W m− 2, but then decreases with the rise of the solar ra-
diation intensity. That is because the efficiency of the electrolyzer de-
creases considerably from more than 90%–80% and the compressor and 
heat exchanger consume more energy. However, the output power of the 
system almost increases linearly from about 0.18 kW to 2.25 kW with 
the solar radiation intensity rising from 100 W m− 2 to 1200 W m− 2 
despite the slight fluctuations in efficiency. 
Fig. 9 indicates that both the power generation and the efficiency of 
the system show a downward trend as the ambient temperature rises 
from 0 ◦C to 40 ◦C and the solar radiation intensity is set at 1000 W m− 2. 
However, the electrolyzer efficiency increase slightly from around 84%– 
85.3% with the decrease of the energy absorbed by photovoltaic module 
as well as the operating current of the electrolyzer. The output power of 
the system drops slightly from around 1.89 kW–1.66 kW during the rise 
of the environmental temperature, which indicates that the output 
power of the system is more significantly affected by the solar radiation 
intensity than by environmental temperature. 
3.4. The feasibility and benefits of building the system in Tianjin area 
Tianjin, located in the northeastern part of the North China Plain, 
belongs to the second-class solar radiation area in China. According to 
the meteorological data of typical meteorological years in Tianjin, the 
city has abundant solar energy resources, and the annual light hours and 
the annual solar radiation are 2600–2800 h a− 1 and 5400–6700 MJ m− 2 
a− 1 respectively. In this section, the feasibility and benefits of the 
photovoltaic-electrolyzer-fuel cell system in Tianjin, China, are analyzed 
based on the meteorological conditions such as daily solar radiation and 
monthly average temperature. The system configuration and operating 
conditions are shown in Table 6. 
Fig. 10 illustrates the average hourly solar radiation and environ-
mental temperature during a total of 160 days from November to next 
April. It is found that the solar radiation starts to increase from 0 W m− 2 
at 5am in the morning, reaches the maximum of above 800 W m− 2 at 
11am, and starts to decrease until 6pm in the evening, while the trend of 
temperature is about 4 h later than that of solar radiation, which means 
the temperature peaks at 4pm and then hit the bottom at 8am. 
The meteorological data such as hourly average solar radiation and 
ambient temperature are put into the photovoltaic-electrolyzer-fuel cell 
system model, so that the hydrogen production, power generation and 
efficiency of the system can be evaluated. As indicated in Fig. 11, the 
tendency of the solar radiation energy, fuel cell output energy and H2 
production are all consistent with the trend of the solar radiation since 
the ambient temperature varies little within a day and it has less influ-
ence on the performance of the system than the solar radiation. The H2 
production rate reaches the maximum of nearly 65 g h− 1 at 11am and 
the average H2 production rate is 36 g h− 1 from 5am to 6pm during the 
day. If the produced H2 is utilized to generate electricity by the fuel cell, 
the peak and average output power of the system in a day are about 
1600 W and 900 W respectively. 
What is more, the performance and efficiency of the system during 
the operation of one year are investigated based on the monthly mete-
orological data in Tianjin. Fig. 12 illustrates the average daily solar ra-
diation and ambient temperature of different months in a year. The 
amount of solar radiation in both spring and autumn are relatively high, 
and the highest daily radiation can reach almost 20 MJ m− 2. However, 
the solar radiation in summer and winter is low since the rainy and 
snowy days are frequent in Tianjin during summer and winter, and the 
lowest daily solar radiation is about 14.8 MJ m− 2. In terms of the 
ambient temperature, the monthly average temperature fluctuates be-
tween 0 ◦C and 30 ◦C throughout the year and the highest temperature 
occurs in summer while the lowest occurs in winter. It is found that the 
monthly H2 production of the system varies with the monthly solar ra-
diation and that the amount of H2 production is highest in February, 
which is nearly 18 kg, as shown in Fig. 13. In addition, the monthly 
power generated by the system ranges from around 1100 MJ to above 
1400 MJ, and the total power generation for the year is 14800 MJ, 
which is equal to about 4100 kWh. 
As basis for evaluating the economic attractiveness of the renewable 
energy utilization system, both capital expenditure and operational 
expenditure are evaluated. As shown in Table 7, the capital expenditure

of a system that comprises 4 kW PV array, 2 kW fuel cell, 2 kW converter, 
3 kW electrolyzer and 6 kg hydrogen tank is about 30000 $. In addition, 
the operational expenditure for operating and maintenance costs of the 
system is about 5% of capital expenditure per year [9], that is about 
1500 $/a. According to the previous analysis, the power generation of 
the system is above 4100 kWh every year and the lifetime of the system 
is supposed to 15 years. In this way, the average cost of energy (COE) is 
about 0.86 $/kWh. In addition, as the service life of the system increases, 
the COE will decrease, and if the lifetime of the system is extended to 25 
years, the average COE will decrease to 0.65 $/kWh.

In all, the total area of the photovoltaic array is 28 m2 and the system 
can collect about 164 kg H2 providing it continuously operates for one 
year. The hydrogen produced can be used to generate electricity by fuel 
cells, and it can generate above 4100 kWh of electricity with the COE of 
0.86 $/kWh, which could almost meet 70% of the annual electricity 
demand of one household in Tianjin. Although the COE is higher than 
market electricity price, hydrogen production from renewable energy 
resources makes it possible to be an environmentally friendly fuel. The 
photovoltaic-electrolyzer-fuel cell system could be extended to factories 
for distributed generation because of the flexible installed capacity, 
which can even reach thousands of megawatts. In addition, the system 
can be constructed almost anywhere where there is plenty of sunshine, 
especially in remote areas or islands, which can avoid the high cost and 
power losses from long-distance transmission. 
The above analysis indicates that building a photovoltaic- 
electrolyzer-fuel cell system for hydrogen production and power gen-
eration is feasible. However, the cost of the system is still high due to the 
high cost of investment. On the one hand, the system configurations 
should be optimized based on the local weather conditions to find the 
optimum system configurations that satisfy the load, reduce the cost of 
energy, and evaluate the renewable energy potential in different areas. 
On the other hand, co-generation application for producing both heat 
and electricity is another solution. Moreover, the system will be more 
economically effective as the industrialization of hydrogen energy and 
the advanced technologies reduce the cost. 
4. Conclusion 
In this study, a renewable energy utilization model, including 
photovoltaic module, electrolyzer module and fuel cell module, is pro-
posed to simulate the performance of hydrogen production and power 
generation system. The novelty is that this study considers the complete 
conversion process of solar energy, from being absorbed by photovoltaic 
cell to be applied by fuel cell. Meanwhile, the effects of key operating 
parameters as well as environmental conditions on the performance of 
the system are analyzed. The models of photovoltaic module, electro-
lyzer module and fuel cell module are validated with experimental data 
and a great agreement is attained. The simulation results show that 
changes in environmental conditions have considerable impact on the 
performance and efficiency of the system. The system efficiency firstly 
climbs but then drops as solar radiation intensity rises while ambient 
temperature remains constant. However, the system efficiency shows a 
monotonically decreasing trend as ambient temperature increases. The 
overall efficiency of the system is about 6%–7% under different envi-
ronmental conditions. In addition, the feasibility and benefits of the 
system in Tianjin, China are investigated, combined with the meteoro-
logical conditions in the area such as daily solar radiation and monthly 
average temperature. The tendency of H2 production rate and system 
output power during a day is consistent with the trend of the solar ra-
diation since the environmental temperature varies little within a day 
and it has less influence on the system performance than the solar ra-
diation. With 28 m2 area of photovoltaic array, the monthly power 
generation of the system ranges from around 1100 MJ to above 1400 MJ 
depending on environmental conditions. The system can generate above 
4100 kWh of electricity for one year, and it can almost meet 70% of the 
annual electricity demand of one household in Tianjin, which illustrates 
that the construction of the photovoltaic-electrolyzer-fuel cell system in 
Tianjin is feasible and can achieve the efficient and clean utilization of 
solar energy. In addition, thanks to the flexible installed capacity, the 
system could be extended to factories or constructed in remote areas or 
islands, which can avoid the high cost and power losses from long- 
distance transmission. Moreover, the model is expected to be further 
extended to investigate the utilization of other renewable energies such 
as wind energy and hydro energy for hydrogen production and power 
generation.
